# Working Agreement

## Team Procedures
- An online meeting will be held every week on Microsoft Teams
- The team uses Discord for communication and Microsoft Teams for meetings only
- There will be no fixed time for meetings, so the time for the meetings will be decided on discord every week
- All project related questions should be answered within 48 hours
- We will use only GitHub for version control

## Team Expectations

### Work Quality
- SwiftUI (and NOT storyboard) will be used in implementing the UI section of the application
-  Members will start their work early so there will be enough time fix unexpected issues/bugs
- Feed back will be provoided to work
- Only technologies specified on the GitHub repository will be used in completing this project
- GitHub repor will be updated regularly

### Team Participation
- Everyone will peform only tasks assigned to them

- All members must attend meetings daily or their tasks will be assigned to them by other team members
